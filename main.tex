\section{Project Background} % Describe how this project came about, who is involved and the purpose
Micropress Inc. published an informal math font loosely based on Adobe Tekton. Since the company has gone out of business, an equivalent doesn't exist. You could of course use similar fonts such as Adobe Tekton and P22 Eaglefeather but, to purchase a license for this font would cost around \$380.00 USD.
My aim with this project is to create an architects style font.

\section{Project Scope} % Project scope defines the boundaries of a project. Think of the scope as an imaginary box that will enclose all the project elements/activities. It not only defines what you are doing (what goes into the box), but it sets limits for what will not be done as part of the project (what doesn’t fit in the box). Scope answers questions including what will be done, what won’t be done, and what the result will look like. 
Utilising support from the scheme
