\section{Project Background} % Describe how this project came about, who is involved and the purpose

\section{Project Scope} % Project scope defines the boundaries of a project. Think of the scope as an imaginary box that will enclose all the project elements/activities. It not only defines what you are doing (what goes into the box), but it sets limits for what will not be done as part of the project (what doesn’t fit in the box). Scope answers questions including what will be done, what won’t be done, and what the result will look like.

\section{Deliverables} % List agencies, stakeholders or divisions which will be impacted by this project and describe how they will be affected by the project
